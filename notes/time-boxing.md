* time boxing vs time blocking?

# what is timeboxing?
- treats time as a fixed budget
	- box out a fixed period of time (timebox)
- timeboxing frames work as a series of inentional, limited spans of focus, rather than an endless to-do list

# variations
- hard timebox
	- means strictly stopping when the timer ends (even if the task isn't done)
- soft timebox
	- is more felixble meaning you "should" stop but can extend if needed
- scrum and agile: time boxing at scale
- pomodoro: specific series of timeboxes

# effective use
- commit timeboxes as appointments with yourself
	- should be visible and treaded like a meeting
- setting a timer is crucial
	- it frees you from clock-watching and holds you accountable
- implementation-intention mindset
	- research suggests, mentally planning "what you will do and when" dramatically improves follow-through

# when and where
- common pitfalls include
	- understading task length
	- feeling rushed
	- being overwhelmed by too many strict slots
- example pitfall
	- if you repeatedly fail to finish important work in a box, it suggests poor estimation or tasks that shouldn’t have been boxed so tightly; the remedy is to start with soft boxes and gradually improve your guesses
	- If you feel constantly racing the clock and producing low-quality work, it’s a sign the boxes are too aggressive; in that case build in breaks or buffer time
	- And if a minute-by-minute schedule feels suffocating, you might switch to broader blocks (time blocking) or simply plan the day at a coarser granularity
